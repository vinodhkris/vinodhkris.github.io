### [You're Mr Lebowski, I'm the Dude : Inducing Address Term Formality in Signed Social Networks](https://github.com/tux4kids/tuxmania) 
This work lies in the intersection of Computational Social Science and Natural Language Processing. The idea is to introduce formality as a latent variable in a social network and predict values using content and network structure as parameters in a completely unsupervised model based on Expectation Maximisation. We introduce a tagger for identifying address terms in dialogue as an additional contribution.
